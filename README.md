# Working with Children Checker
This project aims to simplify the validation of working with children checks in all Australian states by automating the entire process and turning it into a node package.

## Motivation
I got the idea for this project when working on an application for a company that performed working with children checks as part of its day to day. The process is laborious and every state has their own validation tool. In Australia, anyone who wants to work with children in any capacity (teacher, volunteer, etc) is required to undergo one of these checks. I wanted to build something that would make it easier and more convenient for businesses and individuals who perform these check regularly.
